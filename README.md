**SQL Skills Used:** Aggregation Functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(): Used to calculate counts, sums, averages, and maximum values for various columns like incidents, costs, and days lost.

Grouping Data: GROUP BY: Groups data by specific columns (e.g., department, plant) to allow aggregation.

Filtering Data:

WHERE: Filters data before aggregation, e.g., to focus on specific incident types or report types.

HAVING: Filters data after grouping, e.g., to find departments with incidents lasting more than two days.

Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns a unique number to rows based on specified ordering, used for ranking incidents or reports.

Date and Time Functions: YEAR(), MONTH(), FORMAT(): Extracts and formats date values for grouping incidents by year, month, or shift.

Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

WITH clause: Used to create reusable query blocks (CTEs) for ranking or filtering data (e.g., ranking departments by incident counts).
