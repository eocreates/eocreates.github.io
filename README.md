# Workplace Safety Analysis (SQL)
**Title:** Workplace Safety Analysis
**SQL Code:** [WorkplaceSafetyAnalysis SQL Code](https://github.com/eocreates/eocreates.github.io/blob/main/WORKPLACE%20SAFETY%20DATA.sql)

**SQL Skills Used:** Aggregation Functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(): Used to calculate counts, sums, averages, and maximum values for various columns like incidents, costs, and days lost.

Grouping Data: GROUP BY: Groups data by specific columns (e.g., department, plant) to allow aggregation.

Filtering Data:

WHERE: Filters data before aggregation, e.g., to focus on specific incident types or report types.

HAVING: Filters data after grouping, e.g., to find departments with incidents lasting more than two days.

Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns a unique number to rows based on specified ordering, used for ranking incidents or reports.

Date and Time Functions: YEAR(), MONTH(), FORMAT(): Extracts and formats date values for grouping incidents by year, month, or shift.

Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

WITH clause: Used to create reusable query blocks (CTEs) for ranking or filtering data (e.g., ranking departments by incident counts).

Sorting Data: ORDER BY: Sorts results by specified columns in ascending or descending order.

**Project Description:** This project involves analyzing workplace safety data to identify patterns and trends related to incidents, costs, and the impact on employees. Using SQL queries to explore a comprehensive dataset, the goal is to provide actionable insights into the frequency and severity of incidents, their associated costs, and the factors influencing safety in the workplace. The analysis covers various aspects, such as incident types, departments, shifts, age groups, plants, and costs, with a focus on identifying high-risk areas and opportunities for improvement

# Hospital patients Analysis (SQL)
**Title:** Hospital Patients Analysis
**SQL Code:** [Hospital_Patients_Analysis SQL Code](https://github.com/eocreates/eocreates.github.io/blob/main/Hospital%20Patient%20Analysis.sql)
**SQL Skills Used:**  Basic Queries: Retrieving and counting data (e.g., using SELECT, COUNT, SUM, AVG).

Grouping & Aggregation: Grouping data by columns (GROUP BY) and filtering groups (HAVING).

Window Functions: Ranking and partitioning data (DENSE_RANK(), SUM() OVER).

Joins & Subqueries: Combining and embedding queries for detailed data retrieval (INNER JOIN, subqueries).

Date Functions: Calculating differences between dates (DATEDIFF).

Stored Procedures: Creating reusable procedures for tasks like matching blood donors.

Conditional Logic: Using CASE statements to categorize data.

**Project Description:** This project involves performing a comprehensive analysis of a healthcare database, aimed at understanding patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment patterns, and financial aspects associated with healthcare services. The queries are designed to extract insights from a dataset containing patient records, including their medical conditions, hospital visits, treatments, billing amounts, insurance providers, and more.

# Salesman Analysis (SQL)
**Title:** Salesman Analysis
**SQL Code:** [Salesman Analysis SQL Code](https://github.com/eocreates/eocreates.github.io/blob/main/Salesjoins.sql)
**SQL Skills Used:** JOIN Operations: Used INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and CROSS JOIN to relate data across Salesman, Customer, and Order tables. Implemented conditional joins to extract relationships (e.g., matching cities, commission-based conditions).

Filtering and Aggregation: Used WHERE clauses with logical operators (e.g., BETWEEN, <>, IS NOT NULL) to filter data accurately. Applied business rules (e.g., customers with grade, purchase amount limits, commission thresholds).

Sorting and Formatting: Used ORDER BY to organize reports chronologically or by business hierarchy. Applied DISTINCT to avoid data duplication in complex join operations.

Cartesian Product Queries: Explored business possibilities using CROSS JOIN to simulate all combinations of customers and salespeople. Applied conditional logic to limit Cartesian outputs to meaningful pairings (e.g., same or different cities).
